# Quad Connectâ„¢ - Pair Project
### Overview


### Reflection Points
1. This project did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach the design and problem solving process for this project?

- For us we had to take time to understand what we wanted our finished product to look like and then work backwards from there. We knew that we wanted a board and had to think about how we wanted to create that. Objects, Arrays of arrays, arrays of hashes, matrix? We also had to think about how our design choices might affect us further down the line. 

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

- I would like to add more of the iteration four options. They all look really cool and like they would be a lot of fun to Ruby gem of this project to have friends play it. 

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

- We did a lot of screen share driver/navigator style working during the school hours. After hours we would do async work on different parts of the project, then bring them back together adn discuss. Whenever there was a stopper of a problem we would work async sync on said problems exploring all the options to find the best resolution.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
