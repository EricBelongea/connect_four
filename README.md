# Quad Connectâ„¢ - Pair Project
### Overview
  This was our first attempt at building a Connect Four style game. For this project we were given a list of functionalities that the game should have at the end. So this is us riding a bike without training wheels for the first time. I found the design aspect to be really interesting and there's a lot one must do in order to get all the moving pieces working together. 

### Gem Use
1. Type `gem install quad_connect` anywhere in your terminal. (Must be a Rubyist)
2. To play, type `quad_connect` wherevers clever!

### Reflection Points
1. This project did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach the design and problem solving process for this project?

- For us we had to take time to understand what we wanted our finished product to look like and then work backwards from there. We knew that we wanted a board and had to think about how we wanted to create that. Objects, arrays of hashes, matrix? We also had to think about how our design choices might affect us further down the line. We found it hard to write Rspec TDD, so a lot of the testing was trial and error in a pry session. We wanted to test whether our gets statements were working and found that mocks and stubs were a possible solution, but we were unable to impliment them. 

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

- I would like to add more of the iteration four options. They all look really cool and like they would be a lot of fun to Ruby gem of this project to have friends play it. 

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

- We did a lot of screen share driver/navigator style working during the school hours. After hours we would do async work on different parts of the project, then bring them back together ann discuss. Whenever there was a stopper of a problem we would work async sync on said problems exploring all the options to find the best resolution. We reachced out to rocks for advice and to nudge us in the right direction when we both got stuck. 

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

- We would discuss design choices and decide what direction to take from there. We changed the board setup a day into the project due to the limitations of our initial choice. We agreed that the current board setup, arrays, was easier to work with and give us more design freedom down the line. When we encountered a road block that prevented us from moving forward, we shared our thinking and approach, and encouraged the other to test our solution ideas in a pry sandbox until either one had success. When we has success, we opened up a 20 year old finelly aged bottle of wine and celebrated the one liner method. Then we took a five minute pom.
